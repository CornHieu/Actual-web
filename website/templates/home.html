        After two months of grueling preparation for the SAT and bringing back
        home a decent result, I was left with like a month or two of summer
        break with pretty much nothing to do and no idea to use the spare time
        for the good. But fast forward a month and a half, here i am with a
        sleeky designed blog that I can be proud of ðŸ˜Ž
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The motivation,initially, sparks from my curiosity regarding all the new
        techs that have been all-the-rage out there. My ambitious mind was
        sprawling with bunch of crazy ideas like trying to build an actual
        <a class="link" href="https://www.salesforce.com/ap/saas/">SaaS</a>
        product or data monetization from
        <a
          class="link"
          href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/web-scraping-attack/#:~:text=Web%20scraping%20is%20the%20process,replicate%20entire%20website%20content%20elsewhere."
          >web scraping</a
        >. But before touching on those things, I wanted to branch out my skills
        first by trying out simple stuffs, which is building a blog!
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        It may sounds boring at first but i think this project is generally a
        good starting point for me. It will be a solid proof for my passion and
        the springboard for all the exciting upcoming things. I was able to get
        my hands on the basics of web developement and how the front-end and
        back-end are interconnected. Not only that, this blog will be the place
        where I document future projects and updates about my life because I
        love sharing my personal experiences.

        When it comes to web development, the first things that comes to me and
        people's mind are html and css. So I taught myself those two via <a class="link" href=""
